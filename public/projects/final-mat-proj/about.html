            <p>
                Hardwork always pays you off, and efforts never go useless. We have learnt it in reality through our
                graniz words and seen it in her sparkling eyes. Since 2010, when the foundation of Lahori Foods was laid
                down through a small cart, we kept moving ahead with a passion that was to take our ancestor's dream and
                effort to the moon.
            </p>
            <p>

                traditional foods. We started with Haleem as our main speciality but now we have many other Pakistani
                and South Indian specialities to tentalize your taste buds and provide you with the best taste in town.
